Purpose
-------

This runbook defines the standard process for managing identified
vulnerabilities across server and application environments, ensuring
risk-based remediation, business impact assessment, and formal risk
acceptance where remediation is not feasible.

The objective is to reduce security risk while maintaining application
stability and business continuity.
